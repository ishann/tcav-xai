# Human-friendly Compositional Explanations with multi-CAV

## Quick Start
### Install dependencies
1. `cd` to the `code/` directory.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` in order to run our code.

### Running Experiments
- To run experiments with the ImageNet dataset, run `code/imagenet/tcav.py` or `code/imagenet/experiments_in_correctness.ipynb`
- To run experiments with the COMPAS dataset, run `<ADD HERE>`
